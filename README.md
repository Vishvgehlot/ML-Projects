## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio repository! 🚀

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my experiments, research, and applied projects in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science**. It documents my journey from fundamental statistical modeling to advanced implementations in **Computer Vision, NLP, and MLOps**.

Each project is self-contained in its own directory with source code, datasets, and documentation.
